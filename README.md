# Chat-Bot
The primary objective of this project is to be able to control my computer with my voice. 

My main focus for the project as of now: 
- be able to create a temporary description of the user based on verbal information (to mimic having a memory) 
- understand keywords that trigger a response from the bot (much like "hey Siri" or "Okay Google")
- perform basic query responses by searching the internet for answers (using Google chrome) 

For the future: 
- be able to auto-sort downloaded files based on extention types (jpgs, pngs, etc. are grouped under photos) 
- be able to preform math questions
- more things when I think of them 

Potential Additions: 
I would love to create my own voice recognition software instead of using the speechrecognitoin and pyaudio libraries. That would be a long ways off due to the intense complexity of the software needed to preform such tasks. Maybe one day though?
